This project demonstrates the use of generics in programming.
Step 1:Pokemon class with no generics
Step 2: Generic Box class that accepts pokemon and Instantiate it.
Step 3: Two type parameters <K,V>, illustration of it.
Step 4: Bounded Gererics, that works with any subclass that extendts Pokemon class.
Step 5: Testing bounded generics that it actually works with the subclasses.
Step 6: Generic swap method that, changes the contents of the two Boxes
Step 7: Playing with Wildcards method, that is able to print any List of Pokemon and its subclasses
